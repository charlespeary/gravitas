# The Vtas programming language

This is a toy language that I have been working on for some time now, and it all started as a shy dive
into [craftinginterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

The language is quite different in terms of how it's working from the one built in the book - Lox, which you can also
find on my [Github account](https://github.com/Sniadekk/lox-rs) with a WebAssembly integration. It's not perfect by any
means which is also the reason why I created Vtas with the mission for it to serve as a very well documented example of
how to build a not so complex, but modular and scalable language, yet easy to grasp.

# What it is?

It's a simple, expression-oriented language compiled to bytecode (and in the hopefully not so distant future also ARM
instructions)
and run by a virtual machine.

# What it is not?

It's not by any means a production-grade language meant to be used in real-world scenarios.
